Our general development process is as follows:

- Faculty / Students express a disconnect where technology can be improved or a solution help bridge the divide or enhance the relationship between them
- We discuss concept with an instructional designer / faculty member about the instructional challenge
- We rapid prototype with a goal of getting the information architecture (IA) correct
- Concept is tried in classroom setting when possible
- Iterate over refinement of IA with minor usability enhancements *using things core to how drupal handles interaction flows*
- Once IA is assumed correct, developer works with those that this directly affects to craft a more usable method of accomplishing the same thing
- We take a more "headless" approach to Drupal, constructing the interfaces and visuals needed that would make this task as automated as possible
- We integrate it with Drupal and put it into the workflow; the interface tapping the same information that was native to Drupal but without the standard admin-UX
