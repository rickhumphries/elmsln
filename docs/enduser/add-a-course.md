Add a Course
==============
ELMS Learning Network is built on the concept that a course is a network. This is both in how we communicate the concept as well as what's actually going on from a technical side. To add a course, go to the [CIS](http://online.elmsln.local). CIS is your controlling brain for all courses networks in elmsln. 

### Add a new course
Log in and click Add+ -> New Course

This form will allow you to add a new course network to elmsln and associate sections / offerings of that course. Think of this as the control center for courses, how they are structured and getting people access to them from a logistics side.

## New Course Form

This form allows you to either add a new course or extend existing course networks.
###Course name / title
Course name might make sense as a type of shortname without any additional punctuation. Like Math 100, which will give you a space of `math100` when the paths are created. Title would be "Long Division" or the topic of the course. This is optional.

###Method of Access
Method of access is one of 4 styles; either completely open, requiring access, requiring authorization from a roster, or an additional level of paid access. These methods are currently established up front and have module / configuration implications. While a network can be modified after the fact to be shifted from open to closed (for example) this isn't recommended.

###Instructional Outline
This is the starting point for the course structure. This allows you to have some default content as far as structure of the outline used in your course. It can help you define instructional conventions for people to stick to like Lesson based with 15 lessons or Unit based. In any case, in case you import material you'll be getting some default laid out pages for visualization purposes (outside of minimal).

###Course Network
These checkboxes relate to the creation of new tools as part of a course network. None of them are required though most people will create Content Outline as part of a "normal" course network. Content Outline would be thought of by most as the online textbook, which if you don't use online texts / want to communicate things this way and just accept online submissions via the Open Studio, then you could do that.
These settings can be changed after the fact but Content Outline has had the most fleshing out as far as capabilities. Studio, Journal, and Discussions all work as well and can be embedded into Content Outline (or each other for that matter).
The only one of these that's an outlier is "Innovative new idea" / "ulmus". This is for the creation of brand new applications or mashing ideas together. If you like messing with Drupal and just want something that looks like it fits into course network this is for you.

More information about all of these tools can be found in the information architecture section of the docs.
