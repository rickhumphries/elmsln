Conflicts can arise during the course of working in this community. They are the reality of humans working together at times.
This document is to attempt to layout out remedies to project associated conflicts. For more on the scope and norms of our community see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/elmsln/elmsln/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which outlines ways of raising an issue formally if one occurs.

## Ways to avoid conflict
We are all busy. We've all got important things to do (to us, and other). We all are human. Here are some ways we can help each other avoid conflict in the first place:
- Always assume positive intent, this is open source and we're trying to build a freer socity
- Try to convey tonality when using text or bare in mind your words being read without intended inflection
- Don't say anything you wouldn't want said to you
- Deescalate communications if they appear to be boiling over

## Remedies
In the event that conflict cannot be avoided, escalating an issue to the Community Working Group (CWG) may result in actions or an outcome that impact all parties. In the event the CWG has to intervene, here are some of the ways they might respond:

- Take no action. For example, if the CWG determines the complaint has not been substantiated or if it is deemed to be outside the purview of the community.
- A request for a private or public apology.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all ELMS:LN spaces (mailing lists, IRC, etc.).
- In the event of illegal or harassing activity, the CWG may advise the matter be escalated to the relevant local law enforcement agency. Note: It is not the role of the CWG to initiate contact with law enforcement on behalf of any of the community members involved in an incident brought before the CWG.

## Conflicts of Interest
In the event of any conflict of interest a working group member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
